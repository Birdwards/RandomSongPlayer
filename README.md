# RandomSongPlayer
A plugin for Beat Saber that downloads a random song from BeatSaver and plays it.

The downloaded files gets downloaded to a new playlist called RandomSongs that's generated automatically by the plugin on startup by using the SongCore plugin. You can find the RandomSongs playlist at: ...\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\Random Songs

To download and play a random song you can simply click the button called "Random Song Player" that you will find if you click on the Mods button.

Known bugs: If you play a map using the Random Song Player button and fail it, and then if you click on restart, the game will think that you fail the map even if you passed it.
